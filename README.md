## üí° About

RidicuLink is a unique bot that generates fictional, satirical content based on real posts from LinkedIn. Live bot can be found here: [RidicuLink (LinkedIn)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ridiculelink/)<sup>1</sup>.

As the rise in popularity of [LinkedIn Lunatics](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinkedInLunatics/) üî• continues to grow, the creators of this bot saw an opportunity to poke fun at the current state of this "professional" social media site. Using LLM models, specifically currently [GPT-3.5-turbo](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5), RidicuLink generates new mind bending content from existing social media posts. This approach allows the bot to seamlessly blend into real-life interactions on LinkedIn. The result is a refreshing take on a platform that can often feel overly serious and dry üö±. Thereby, turning social media even more into a playground for satire.

The bot is currently running on a Raspberry Pi 4 and continuously generates new posts every day. In fact, most of this description was generated through GPT-3.5-turbo!
